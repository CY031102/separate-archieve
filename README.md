# Seperate-archive
This code uses 7-Zip to archive all selected files individually instead of putting them in one compressed file.

###Change the 7-Zip location to your location
```
#7zip location

seven_zip = r"C:\Applications\7-Zip\7z.exe"  #change the directory to where your 7zip is located
```

Run the python file and select the files you want to add to archive and encrypt. (by default is 127 ascii letters and string digits in length together)

Your Password will show up in the running IDLE once the compression is complete.
